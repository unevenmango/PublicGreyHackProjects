# 52 Graphical Deck of Cards
  I wanted to make a easy to use graphical card list. The Templete is labeld, and the  + " !"    at the end of the lines for your card graphic. please keep them in there as i was having some bugs with .split("\n"). so its a work around but it still works. This will place a list of small maps of cards identified by card.gfx as the graphical store and card.id for the logic in the game.
