# 52 Graphical Deck of Cards
  I wanted to make a easy to use graphical card list. The Templete is labeld, and the  + " !"    at the end of the lines for your card graphic. please keep them in there as i was having some bugs with .split("\n"). so its a work around but it still works. This will place a list of small maps of cards identified by card.gfx as the graphical store and card.id for the logic in the game. I hope to see some Gameception in The web of greyhacks future!
 
# metaXploitFrameWork / Public Build : 
  Made a fun Exploit creator that i enjoyed useing. Unlike other tools it as no overflow in the active script. Everything is generated with the finest exploits and the largest adjective list ever created (by me). Nothing may be documented in script help please play around. OH anything set as a number is a bool ether 0 or 1. 
  type 'help' for basics. 'use' a module. --> 'help' in module

.note
  localexploitation was just slapped in there so a better idea is needed altho the script works.
  I understand the script isent very helpfull for learning nor can you imagin me comfortable working with it.
